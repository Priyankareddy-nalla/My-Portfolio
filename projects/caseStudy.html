          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>MyFlix is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN and MEAN stacks.
            The app allows users to sign up and log in. Logged-in users can access a collection
            of movies, including details about their directors and genres. Users can add movies
            to their favorite list and view this list in their profile. They can also update
            their user information and delete their account if they wish.
          </p>
          <h1>Purpose and Context</h1>
          <p>The MyFlix project was created during my web development course at CareerFoundry.
            The main goal was to demonstrate my skills in JavaScript and TypeScript development.
            This project highlights my experience with frameworks like React and Angular, as well
            as my ability to write clear documentation. It gave me the opportunity to apply what I
            learned in a real-world setting.

          <h3>Deadlines</h3>
          <p>
            Milestones included completing the back-end API, developing front-end interfaces, and conducting user
            testing.

              <h2>Server-side project:</h2>
              <p>
                I developed a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, which interacts with a MongoDB database.
                The API supports standard HTTP methods such as GET and POST for performing CRUD (Create, Read,
                Update, Delete) operations on movie information. It returns data in JSON format.
              </p>

                target="_blank">Endpoints</a>

              <p>
                For testing the API endpoints, I utilized the Postman tool to ensure their functionality and
                reliability. Additionally, I documented the project using JSDoc comments and TypeDoc to
                provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of the API's functionality and usage.
              </p>

              <h2>Client-side project:</h2>
              <p>For the client-side development, I used both React and Angular frameworks to create a dynamic and
                responsive user interface. By utilizing these frameworks,
                I was able to efficiently fetch movie details from the database through server-side API endpoints. This
                data integration allowed me to dynamically display and manage movie information, such as titles and
                director name, directly within the front-end application. React's component-based architecture and
                Angular's
                data-binding features enabled seamless updates and interactive elements, enhancing the overall user
                experience with real-time content and intuitive navigation.</p>

          <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Deployment Issues in Angular: Faced challenges deploying the Angular app on GitHub Pages due to
              configuration issues.

            <li>Solution: Resolved by using the angular-cli-ghpages package to automate the deployment process and
              ensure that build artifacts were correctly published to GitHub Pages.</li>
            </li>
            <li>Git Merge Conflicts in React: Encountered merge conflicts during the deployment of the React app,
              particularly when integrating branches with different feature sets.

            </li>
            <li>Solution: Implemented a strategy for resolving merge conflicts by carefully reviewing changes, using git
              mergetool, and maintaining clear commit histories. This helped to minimize conflicts and ensure smooth
              integration of new features.</li>
